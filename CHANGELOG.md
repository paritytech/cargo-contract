## [0.18.0] - 2022-03-14

### Interact with contracts: upload, instantiate and call commands

We added commands to upload, instantiate and call contracts!
This allows interacting with contracts on live chains with a compatible
[`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts).

For command-line examples on how to use these commands see [#79](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/pull/79).

### Linting rules for smart contracts

We are introducing a linter for ink! smart contracts in this release!
From now on `cargo-contract` checks if the ink! smart contract that is
`build` or `check`-ed follows certain rules.

As a starting point we've only added one linting rule so far; it asserts correct
initialization of the [`ink_storage::Mapping`](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_storage/struct.Mapping.html)
data structure.

In order for the linting to work with your smart contract, the contract has to be
written in at least ink! 3.0.0-rc9. If it's older the linting will just always succeed.

### Added
- Interact with contracts: upload, instantiate and call commands - [#79](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/pull/79)

- Minimize contract wasm binary size:
  - Run `wasm-opt` on the contract Wasm binary.
  - Uses [`cargo-xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild) to build custom sysroot crates without panic string
bloat.
  - Automatically removes the `rlib` crate type from `Cargo.toml`, removing redundant metadata.
- Removes requirement for linker args specified in `.cargo/config`.
- Added `--verbose` and `--quiet` flags for `build` and `generate-metadata` commands.
