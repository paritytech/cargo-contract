    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    new                  Setup and create a new smart contract project
    build                Compiles the smart contract
    generate-metadata    Generate contract metadata artifacts
    test                 Test the smart contract off-chain
    deploy               Upload the smart contract code to the chain
    instantiate          Instantiate a deployed smart contract
    help                 Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

## `build` requires the `nightly` toolchain

`cargo contract build` must be run using the `nightly` toolchain. If you have 
[`rustup`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup) installed, the simplest way to do so is `cargo +nightly contract build`.
To avoid having to add `+nightly` you can also create a `rust-toolchain` file in your local directory containing 
`nightly`. Read more about how to [specify the rustup toolchain](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup#override-precedence).

## Features

The `deploy` and `instantiate` subcommands are **disabled by default**, since they are not fully stable yet and increase the build time.

If you want to try them, you need to enable the `extrinsics` feature:

`cargo install --git https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract cargo-contract --features extrinsics --force`

Once they are stable and the compilation time is acceptable, we will consider removing the `extrinsics` feature.
